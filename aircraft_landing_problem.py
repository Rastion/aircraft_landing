    Aircraft Landing Problem:
    Given an instance of the aircraft landing scheduling problem, schedule landing times
    and a landing order for a set of planes so as to minimize the total penalty cost
    (due to early or late landings) while respecting separation time constraints.
    
    Instance data (from the OR-Library) has the following format:
      - First line: number of planes and freeze time.
      - For each plane:
          appearance time (ignored),
          earliest landing time,
          target landing time,
          latest landing time,
          penalty cost per unit time for landing early,
          penalty cost per unit time for landing late,
          then for each plane j: separation time required after this plane lands before j can land.
      
    Note: The static version ignores appearance time and freeze time.
